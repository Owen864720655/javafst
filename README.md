# javafst

This is mostly taken from
[Sphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/sphinx4/tree/master/sphinx4-core/src/main/java/edu/cmu/sphinx/fst)
with a small amount of clean-up, making it obey Google style checks, etc.

# TODO:

- Lots of the IO statements can be inlined.
- Lots of finals.
- regular "for" loops
- Java8 IO "Files."
